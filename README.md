3. Rename your primary map file to `world.mbtiles` or update the path in `server/mapTileServer.ts`

For quick testing, you can use the provided script:

# Make the script executable
chmod +x tiles/download-sample-tiles.sh

# Run the script to download a sample map
./tiles/download-sample-tiles.sh
```

For advanced map processing, the application can leverage GDAL and MapServer libraries. See the documentation in the `tiles` directory for installation instructions and usage details.

The recommended versions are:
